## Exercise

Let's get into our groups (Canvas > People > Groups). In Canvas, under Files, let's look at the historical documents and correspondence we have for your assigned Rutgers College alumnus. Let's see what biographical information we can piece together about these men from the documents. 

- Date or place of birth, death?
- Cause of death?
- What did they look like (physical description)?
- Rutgers class year?
- Branch of military in which they served?
- Rank in military?
- Other Rutgers people they knew?
- Activities they enjoyed while at Rutgers?
