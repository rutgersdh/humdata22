summary: "For me, text encoding is a totally new thing"

For me, text encoding is a totally new thing. I have no experience of encoding and creating a blog or website before, so it might be difficult for me to learn a new skill within a short time. I also consider encoding is a boring and time-consuming thing because you need to write a lot of elements without any syntax mistake. However, during the process of learning text encoding, I gradually understand why text encoding is important and how it influences us. Text encoding is not only about learning syntax, but also it brings It brings great reference value and historical significance to people as a carrier of information. People use text encoding to save information, and the file that includes information is consistent and easy to access. Rather than information recorded by physical materials, such as books and papers, it provides people with a convenient way to attain information. Also, because electronic document is consistent, it plays an important role in transcribing historical documents. The information in files will not disappear, and it allows us to discover things happened in the past, which means we can learn from the past and improve ourselves. In this lab, I am glad to learn text encoding and have access to know things happened in the last century. Although I am just in the beginning stage of encoding, the process of learning it gives me a sense of achievement.

However, because I am new, I still do not know a lot about syntax and declaration. This is the mistake I made when I begin to encode. I simply put information within the instructions without delete them.
