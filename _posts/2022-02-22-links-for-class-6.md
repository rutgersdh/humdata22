## Reading

Horne, John. [“Soldiers, Civilians and theWarfare of Attrition: Representations
of Combat in France, 1914-1918.”](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/158985/files?preview=22982731) In _Authority, Identity and the Social History of the Great War_, edited by Frans Coetzee and Marilyn Shevin-Coetzee, 325–55. Providence, RI: Berghahn Books, 1995.

## Letters 1916-23

Susan Schreibman et al., _Letters 1916-1932_, <http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/>.

A project that is similar to ours, only it spans many institutional collections in Ireland and accommodates crowdsourced transcription and contributions. What can we understand about the collection as a whole through the study of the "Visual Exploration" options?

Let's spend more time on last week's lab, [Close Reading with the TEI](https://github.com/giannetti/TEI-Close-Reading), focusing especially on research on people and places mentioned in the letters. Let's try crowdsourcing this work at the following [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VtGAoCq65Mq1Lt7S9EIxCCTUMSupKystCsYNKeaDANQ/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Sheet). Don't forget about next week's [blog post](https://rutgersdh.github.io/humdata22/2022/02/15/links-for-class-5/#blog-post-no-2) assessing your experience of this lab.
