Why This Dataset
================

The title of this dataset, "What do Men Think It Means To Be A Man,"
drew me in with its bold, targeted question as I was scrolling on
Kaggle. The definition and criteria of a "man" is subjective. Yet the
idea is saturated with long-held toxic beliefs about stoicism,
aggression, misogyny, homophobia, and a myriad of other problematic
behaviors. I was curious about what men thought of the matter.

The Origin Story
================

There is no specific reason for the dataset's creation. However, the
data's source comes from a SurveyMonkey survey, created by
FiveThirtyEight, a journalistic organization under ABC News.
FiveThirtyEight values empiricism, accuracy, transparency, inclusivity,
humility, personality, and completeness ("About Us"[^fn1]). Compiling data
about masculinity from the targeted demographic further aids studies
about gender, race relations, sexual orientation, sexual harassment, and
society's role in these areas. Furthermore, the dataset's curator, Yam
Peleg, implies that he assembles datasets in Kaggle to identify
"real-world problems" (Peleg[^fn2]). Hence, the data is for both scientific
and social purposes.

Limitations of the Dataset
==========================

The primary issues with the masculinity survey are that the sample
population is too small to be accurate and that it is missing a core
demographic. 1,615 men is not enough to gauge the opinion of a country,
let alone the entire world ("What Does..."). Furthermore, transgender
men are not specified or included in the data. This group will certainly
hold a unique perspective on what it means to be a man. FiveThirtyEight
should add a column for them.

Questions to Explore
====================

Possible questions to explore using this dataset are:

-   Why do 65% of employed, adult men **not** think about their behavior
    differently in the wake of \#MeToo? For what reason are most men
    **not reflective**?

-   Why is weight the biggest daily concern for 54% of men, out of the
    other listed reasons?

The necessary modifications to carry out my plans for further analysis
require open-ended answers from the participants, or at least a branch
off of questions with provided possible answers for those who did select
"not think about behavior differently" or "weight."

Building an Argument
====================

I would present an argument based on this dataset by grouping relevant
statistics together based on subject matter---such as asking for
professional advice and openness to seeing a therapist---and then
organizing the information by demographic category. Once my information
is assembled, I would direct my concluding remarks to sociologists,
interested news media, and men as a whole.
