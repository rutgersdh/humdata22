*What is the aim of the particular method or approach demonstrated in the lab? What relationships, trends or patterns emerged? Did you find the process or the results compelling? Why or why not? What failed to go as you had expected? Why? Were you able to make creative use of a failure? How do your findings relate to the reading(s)? Do they verify, extend, or challenge the arguments of the reading(s)?*

The aim of the method demonstrated in this lab allows us to see the trends of data of the individuals found in the War Service Bureau. Allowing us to see the locations of the letters and where they were going. The relationship in the map shows where the letters were going and the frequency of where they were being delivered. The middle ground was Rutgers University because individuals like Earl Reed Silvers could distribute the soldier’s letters to family and friends, while also responding to them. I found it compelling because there was no such instant messaging at that time, and for them to rely so heavily on their mail reaching back as their only source of communication, is quite interesting. What failed to go as expected was the less than expected number of letters received to the Rutgers or recovered. The findings in the week 6 article, “Soldiers, Civilians and the Warfare of Attrition” connect well with this lab because it really demonstrates a soldier’s mindset. How the letters they send are their only way of keeping their sanity and having contact with their loved ones. I also found it quite interesting how even though soldiers faced hard times and extreme conditions they still found some happiness or times of joy in their services, something which they demonstrate in their letters. The image below serves to justify the importance of the War Service Bureau in Rutgers at that time because it serves to allow us to understand the impact of their lives at the time, enabling us to remember their contribution and be able to connect to them.
