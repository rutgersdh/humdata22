summary: 'I chose this dataset because I want to learn more about what makes a good college good'

1. I chose this dataset because I want to learn more about what makes a good college good
and what about the college makes them better than others. What makes this blog post
interesting is that it explains that debt, faculty with doctoral degrees, and financial
resources. It also compares the weight between national and regional universities.
2. This data was compiled for the 2022 US News and World Report Best College rankings.
The data is intended to show the differences and similarities between national and
regional colleges based on 17 qualities that make a college good.
3. The limitations of this dataset is that regional and national universities are too similar
with the one exception of national universities selecting the top 10% of a student’s high
school class, while regional universities select the top 25% of a student’s high school
class. The question that can’t be explored in this data is what makes regional colleges
better than national colleges.
4. Some questions I could explore using this data is why are national and regional colleges
so similar, and why do national colleges choose the top 10% of a high school class while
regional universities choose the top 25% of a high school class. There are no
modifications that would be needed.
5. I would present my argument based on this dataset to an audience by proposing that
national and regional universities are almost identical in the 2022 Best College rankings
so any student that struggles to decide between the two knows that these types of
universities aren’t different from each other.
