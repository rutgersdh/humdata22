## Discussion of Reading

D’Ignazio, Catherine, and Lauren Klein. [“On Rational, Scientific, Objective Viewpoints from Mythical, Imaginary, Impossible Standpoints.”](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/5evfe9yd/release/5) In _Data Feminism_. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2020.

1. What are the authors getting at with their exhortation to "Elevate Emotion and Embodiment"? Can you give an example from the reading of what they mean? What do you think about this principle?

2. Can we explain the concepts of "the god trick" and "partial perspective," from Donna Haraway's work as cited by the authors? How do they relate to the authors' ideas about visualization rhetoric?

3. Can we think of any other examples of "data visceralization," other than those cited by the authors? In what ways does communication via senses other than the eyes assist our comprehension? How do we feel about that supposed emotion--reason binary? 

## Networks Lab

For the rest of the class, we'll work through [an exercise on network analysis](/humdata22/networks/), first using War Service Bureau data, then hopefully survey data.
